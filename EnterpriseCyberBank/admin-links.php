<!-- The purpose of this page is to link to two separate log-ins that  -->

<ul>
   <br>
  <li><p> The following link is our recently created more secure register log-in form due to a recent security 
      breach: <a href="hash-register.php">Click here for secure log-in!</a></p></li>
      <br>
      <li><p> <u> We recommend the secure log-in above but the old log-in is still available below.</p> </u> </li>
         <br>
         <li> <p> The following link is the log-in page that was unfortunately breached but a few additional security questions have recently been added: 
            <a href="secure-login.html">Click here for less secure log-in!</a></p></li>
